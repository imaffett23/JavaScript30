    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Ian';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Kim';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';  //This updates the original array that was referenced too!
    console.log(players, team); 

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); //Does copy when you pass it no arguments

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); //Another option

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players); //One last method

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;  //Updates both

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(captain2, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const ian = {
      name: 'Ian',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@blahblah',
        facebook: 'blahblah.dev'
      }
    }

    console.log(ian);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, ian); //Only assigns one level deep ==> changing values deeper will change the referenced object too:(
    //Would have to cloneDeep (can find online)

    //Hacky way to handle it
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ian)); //Returns a string and then parse it back into an object
